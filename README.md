My project is called the Wheel of Life. I created this web app in my native language of Polish, because such a tool does not yet exist on the Polish market.

The wheel of life is a visual representation of a person's life areas, which are important to him or her. These could be for example: work, fitness, intimate relationships, spirituality, etc.
The wheel is divided into 8 parts, each of which represents one of these areas. The user then rates their progress and fulfillment in each area on a scale of 1 to 10 from least satisfied to most satisfied.
The resulting wheel visualises how the person is balancing the different aspects of their life which they deem important.

The web application allows the user to generate a wheel of their own by ranking pre-specified life areas. The ranking values can be adjusted using interactive sliders.
The interactive polar area chart was created using the Chartjs library and animated using JavaScript, which was also utilised for the sliders.

The user is also able to specify their overall goals in the different life areas and have them handy in one place. The user can specify the goals by filling out respective forms and these are then displayed in a table.
Should the user change their goals in the future, they can access a goal history table to review how their aims changed over time (goals are recorded with a timestamp).

Standard features of registration, login/logout and password change were also added to the web application to enhance user experience.
